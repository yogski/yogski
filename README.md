## Welcome to yogski's Github.
My name is Yogi Saputro. Please have a nice seat as you dive into my profile.
I describe myself as developer with business acumen, somehow managed to get engineering and MBA degree.
I identify the business problem, talk to people, crunch numbers, translate it to technical statements, discuss the solution and trade-offs, build the solution, and deliver the solution.
Communication is as important as the code.
